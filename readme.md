# IMP Overview
A Matlab toolbox for rigorous and nonrigorous parameterization of invariant manifolds for ODEs. Invariant sets are parameterized as coefficient sequences in some analytic function space and a proof of existence and rigorous error bounds come in the form of a-posteriori analytic error estimates.

See REFS for further details and examples.

# Classes
The basic usage revolves around several classes which efficiently perform and store important computations. Each class is briefly outlined below.

## Scalar
The scalar class gives a finite approximation representation for analytic functions of the form, $f: D^d \to \mathbb{R}^n$ where $D^d$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^d$.

### Properties
* Basis: Taylor, Fourier, Chebyshev
* Coefficient: A $d$-dimensional array of coefficients
* Dimension: The value of $d$ which is equivalent to the number of nontrivial dimensions in the coefficient array.
* NumericalClass: double or intval (requires IntLab toolbox for Matlab)
* Truncation: Integer vector of length $d$ denoting the number of coefficients in each direction.


### Hidden Properties
* Weight: Allows specification of weights for alternate $\ell_1$ weights. This should only be set to 'ones' to optimize numerical stability.
